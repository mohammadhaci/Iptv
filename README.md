OwnTV is a native **Android TV** IPTV **player** built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose for TV, and a
**dual playback engine** — **libmpv (FFmpeg)** for movies/series and maximum compatibility, **ExoPlayer
(Media3)** for near-instant Live TV. It's a *player only* — you bring your own Xtream login, M3U playlist
(by **URL or a local `.m3u`/`.m3u8` file** on the device), or **Stalker/Ministra portal (Portal URL + MAC
address)**, and OwnTV gives you a fast, modern, remote-first way to browse and watch them.

> ⚠️ OwnTV does **not** provide any channels, playlists, subscriptions, streams, or media content.
> You are responsible for adding your own legally accessible sources.

This is an **open-source** project — the code is original (not derived from any other app) and was
**built with the help of AI**. **Contributions are welcome**: clone, build, and test it freely. It
targets **Android TV only** (leanback launcher, D-pad-first UI).

> ### 📖 New here? Read the [**User Guide & Hidden Features →**](extras/USER_GUIDE.md)
> Long‑press to favourite, **Left** for the channel list, the MPV/EXO toggle's **compatibility mode**,
> catch‑up from the Guide, startup landing, A/V‑sync — all the remote shortcuts in one place.

## ✨ Features

### 🎬 Playback
- **Dual-engine design**
  - **libmpv (FFmpeg)** — movies, series, and any stream ExoPlayer can't open; maximum codec/container compatibility, every audio/subtitle track
  - **Media3 (ExoPlayer)** — Live TV default; near-instant HLS start, instant preview → fullscreen
  - **Per-channel mpv toggle** — the MPV/EXO pill pins a problem channel to mpv (remembered per channel)
  - **VOD engine fallback** — a movie/episode that terminally fails on one engine is retried on the
    other automatically; a setting picks which plays first (mpv default, or ExoPlayer for devices
    where mpv can't start VODs)
- **Direct-to-display rendering** — zero-copy 4K HDR path, app-drawn subtitles, auto software-decode fallback
- **Channel zapping** — D-pad/CH±/media keys, wraps around; **in-player channel list** (Left with controls hidden)
- **Audio** — surround sound (opt-in, Dolby/DTS → multichannel LPCM, auto-stereo safety net); volume boost to 150%; A/V sync nudge
- **Subtitles** — text (SRT/ASS) + image (PGS/VOBSUB/DVB on its own layer) + closed captions (CEA-608/708)
- **Resume & auto-play** — per-title resume prompt, auto-play next episode (across seasons) with a next-episode countdown card, opens on last-watched episode, watched ✓ / progress indicators on movies and episodes
- **Mini-player / PiP** — dock any stream and keep browsing
- **Stream info overlay** — live codec · resolution · fps · HDR · bitrate · decoder readout
- 📺 **[Complete player design & feature reference →](extras/player.html)**

### 🧭 Browse
- **Home screen** — Continue Watching hero carousel (partially-watched movies, episodes, recent channels) with dwell-to-expand previews that pull in **TMDB backdrops, title logos and plot**; fully customizable per profile (reorder/hide rows, hero filters, "On Now" inline mini-guide rows); feeds system Watch Next on stock Android TV
- **Sections** — Live TV (preview + real stream resolution badge), Movies, Series, Downloads, EPG Guide
- **Fixed layout** — stable icon nav · full-label category column · content · preview (never expands/collapses)
- **Categories** — Favorites & History per section, full names, search box; customize (hide/rename/reorder, range-select); hide/unhide individual channels, movies & series; optional PIN lock; survives re-syncs
- **Search** — inline per-folder + global; launcher home (Continue / Unwatched / Channels + recent searches); **list + detail pane** with a primary action per result; Back clears the query first; long-press to favorite
- **Continue chip** — shared top-bar chip resumes your most-recent movie / episode / channel in one press, on every screen
- **Multiple playlists** — merge them all, or narrow the whole app to one via the **top-bar playlist switcher** (or a per-playlist **Default** toggle in Settings); applies to Live/Movies/Series/EPG/Search/Home incl. Favorites & History, and persists across restarts
- **Sort & view** — playlist order or A–Z; Movies & Series Grid/List toggle
- **Per-profile startup** — Home, last channel, or Live TV on Favorites
- **Built for scale** — ~50k channels / ~168k movies via Paging 3
- **Fast syncing** — priority import (pick e.g. Live TV first, the rest finishes in the background — survives sleep/reboot); incremental re-syncs only write what changed; auto-retrying downloads
- **Typed M3U playlists** — `type=` / `tvg-type=` tags route entries to **Movies** or **Series** (per-episode `S01E05` lines are grouped into shows, seasons and episodes automatically)
- 📡 **Stalker / Ministra portals** — add a source with just a **Portal URL + MAC address**; Live TV, Movies & Series (lazy episode loading), downloads, EPG/catch-up and TMDB enrichment all work; play links are minted per-play and **auto-renewed when they expire** (long live sessions and long downloads survive token resets); MAG User-Agent presets for picky portals
- 🎬 **TMDB metadata enrichment** — optional, on-demand posters, plots, cast, genres & ratings for Movies, Series and Episodes; **in-app trailers**; manual Refetch / "Set TMDB name" overrides; works with zero setup, your own TMDB key, or a self-hosted [caching proxy](worker/)

### 🗓️ EPG / TV Guide
- **Guide grid** — time × channel (XMLTV); now/next/later in preview; two-stage nav (Right selects row, OK browses)
- **Catch-up TV** — watch aired programmes (up to 7 days back); seekable archive replay; catch-up time setting
- **Live rewind** — timeshift on catch-up channels; scrubbable timeline + 30s steps + Live button
- **EPG matching** — auto-match by name (ignoring HD/country tags); long-press for manual match; survives re-syncs
- **Sort & filter** — A–Z / Provider / Live TV / Catch-up / Favorites; category filter with search
- **Multiple sources** — add/edit/delete XMLTV feeds; merge into guide; opt-in (pre-fills playlist URL)
- **Performance** — pre-loaded at startup; only your channels' programmes stored; malformed-tag tolerant

### 👥 Profiles
- Multiple profiles (own favorites/history/resume); PIN locks (salted hash); kids flag; "Who's watching?" gate; shared sources

### ⬇️ Downloads
- Offline movies & episodes (never Live TV); pause/resume/retry; user-chosen folder; **Active / Waiting / Completed / Failed** queue groups; **storage bar** with free space
- **Poster status strip** — a download's live status (Downloading / Queued / Paused, with progress) shows on the movie / series / episode poster panel while it's in flight

### 🎨 Personalization & Settings
- **Settings search & quick toggles** — filter Settings with a search box (results show their group, e.g. `Playback › HDR`); one-press quick toggles for the most-used options
- **Appearance** — Material 3 (dark/light/system); any accent color (palette or hex); UI zoom; avatars; animations toggle
- **Content** — clear watch history (all or per-type); per-source **Auto refresh** for playlists & EPG (Off by default, startup or 6–48h staleness intervals)
- **Sidebar Menu Customization** — **Static** (manually hide any side icon) or **Dynamic** (icons auto-adapt to what the active playlist contains — a VOD-only playlist hides Live TV/Guide, a Live-only playlist hides Movies/Series/Downloads); included in backups
- **Video Player** — hardware decoding, zoom, subtitle size/language, audio sync, surround sound, HDR, **external player** (VLC / MX Player for movies, series & downloads — global setting or per-item long-press)
- **Weather** — top-bar weather chip: on/off, custom location (VPN-friendly), **°C / °F**
- **Backup & Restore** — profiles, sources, customizations, favorites, history, resume, manual Move positions, settings, auto-refresh choices, default source, per-item engine/compatibility pins and custom TMDB names; choose what to include
- **Updates** — in-app from GitHub Releases; auto-check (toggleable) + manual; installs APK on TV
- **Android TV home** — feeds system Watch Next row; refresh button

### 🛡️ Robustness
- **Memory-safe** — device-scaled buffers; decode watchdog (4K/8K SW guard); background release; cache shedding
- **No ANRs** — all player commands off the UI thread; coalesced preview-scroll loads
- **Connection-friendly** — preview→fullscreen reuses stream; auto-reconnect on drops
- **Resilient imports** — HTTP 512 / truncated list → per-category fallback; credentials never shown
- **Offline detection** — banner + offline-aware error messages

## 🧱 Tech stack

| Area | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Language | Kotlin 2.3.10 (AGP 9 **built-in Kotlin**, no `kotlin-android` plugin) |
| Build | AGP 9.2.1 / Gradle 9.4.1, KSP2 2.3.9 |
| UI | Jetpack Compose for TV (`androidx.tv:tv-material` 1.1.0), Compose BOM 2026.05.00 |
| Media | **libmpv** (FFmpeg) — `dev.jdtech.mpv:libmpv` · **ExoPlayer/Media3** (Live TV + image subs) |
| Database | Room 2.8.4 + Paging 3.5.0 + FTS4 (WAL) |
| DI | Koin 4.1.1 |
| Networking | OkHttp |
| Images | Coil 3.3.0 |
| Preferences | DataStore |

`minSdk 26`, `targetSdk 36`, `applicationId tv.own.owntv`.

> **Build note:** Kotlin comes from AGP 9's built-in Kotlin (no `kotlin-android` plugin). KSP 2.3.6+
> supports built-in Kotlin, so Room codegen works alongside it; the Compose compiler and KSP track
> Kotlin 2.3.x.

## ⚙️ How it works (backend)

- **Parsing & sync** — M3U playlists are line-streamed and Xtream `player_api` JSON is read with
  `android.util.JsonReader`, so huge provider payloads are never fully buffered. `SyncManager` does a
  clear-then-insert refresh in ~500-row chunked transactions with Flow progress and cancellation.
- **Storage** — a 19-entity Room schema: profiles & sources (`ProfileSourceCrossRef` for sharing),
  content (categories/channels/movies/series/seasons/episodes), per-profile favorites/history/progress/
  downloads, EPG channels/programmes, and FTS4 search tables. Totals come from indexed `COUNT` queries.
- **Lists** — Paging 3 with a bounded `maxSize` keeps memory flat across 50k+ item lists.
- **EPG** — bulk XMLTV is stream-parsed (gzip-aware) into a rolling now→+48h window and pruned.
- **Player** — two engines behind a small `PlaybackEngine` interface: **libmpv** (movies/series, and any
  live stream ExoPlayer can't open) and **ExoPlayer/Media3** (Live TV — instant HLS). Live "promotes" the
  running preview straight to full-screen (no reload); the shell hoists the active surface across full ↔
  mini-player. Player state is published as `StateFlow`s for the Compose HUD.
- **DI** — Koin modules (`appModule`, `databaseModule`, `dataModule`, `playerModule`).

## 📥 Installing (Fire TV / Android TV)

Grab the signed APK from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/releases/latest) and
sideload it. A fixed link always points at the newest signed build:

```
https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/releases/latest/download/OwnTV.apk
```

- **Fire TV** — install the **Downloader** app (by AFTVnews) from the Amazon Appstore, then enter the
  **Downloader code `4308278`** (or [`aftv.news/4308278`](https://aftv.news/4308278), which always
  points at the latest signed `OwnTV.apk`). Enable *Apps from Unknown Sources* if prompted.
- **Android TV / Google TV** — the **Downloader** app is also on Google Play, so the same code
  **`4308278`** works here too. (If Downloader doesn't show in search, open the Play Store on the TV —
  you can reach it via *Settings → Apps → See all apps → Show system apps → Google Play Store* — and
  install it from there.) Or just sideload the APK with your tool of choice (*Send files to TV*, a USB
  drive, or `adb install OwnTV.apk`).

> Only install the APK from this repository's official Releases (or the `…/releases/latest/download/OwnTV.apk`
> link above). It's the build signed by this project's CI — third-party re-hosts aren't endorsed.

## 🛠️ Building & running

1. Open the project in **Android Studio** (a version matching AGP 9.x) and let Gradle sync.
2. Run the `app` configuration on an **Android TV** emulator or device. The app declares a
   `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER` **and** a regular `LAUNCHER` entry and marks the leanback feature **optional**, so
   it shows in the **TV launcher** on Android TV and as a normal app icon on phones/tablets and non-TV
   boxes too (minimum **Android 8.0 / API 26**).
3. Or from the command line:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

On first launch you'll go through onboarding: accept the disclaimer, create a profile, then **add a
source** (M3U, Xtream, or Stalker/MAC portal) — or import a backup. After it imports, browse from the sidebar and open the
**Guide** for the EPG. Everything is managed under **Settings**.

**Tested on:** a real **TCL Google TV**, and the **Android Studio emulator** (both the Android TV and
Google TV system images).

## 🤖 CI & releases

GitHub Actions ([`.github/workflows/android.yml`](.github/workflows/android.yml)) builds the app in the
cloud — no local build needed:

- **Every push / PR** → builds a debug APK and uploads it as a workflow **artifact** named
  `OwnTV-v<version>-<sha>.apk` (download it from the run's *Summary → Artifacts*).
- **Push a `v*` tag** (e.g. `git tag v1.1.0 && git push origin v1.1.0`) → builds a **signed** APK and
  publishes a **GitHub Release** with `OwnTV-v1.1.0.apk` attached. The release notes are taken from
  the newest section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) (which the in-app updater shows as
  "What's new"), plus GitHub's auto-generated commit list.

**Versioning is automatic**: `versionName`/`versionCode` are derived from the tag (e.g. `v1.1.0` →
`1.1.0` / `10100`) — no need to touch `build.gradle.kts`.

**Signed release builds (optional, recommended for distribution).** Tag builds are debug-signed until you
add a release keystore. Create one and add four repo **Secrets** to get properly signed releases:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore owntv.keystore -alias owntv -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
base64 -w0 owntv.keystore   # copy the output into the KEYSTORE_BASE64 secret
```

Then add repo Secrets (*Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*): `KEYSTORE_BASE64`,
`KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`. Keep the keystore file private — it's never committed.
