# OwnTV — App Changelog (minimal)

> Short release notes shown inside the app's update dialog: two parts per version — New features
> (by name) and Fixes. The full, detailed changelog is [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Hand-maintained —
> edit this file directly alongside CHANGELOG.md, condensing per version (do not copy bullets verbatim).
>
> **Rule: bullet points only — no descriptions.** Each line is a short bolded feature/fix title and
> nothing more. The ONLY extra detail ever allowed is a contribution credit for community work
> (e.g. `(community PR #40 by @codeVerine)`). Issue numbers that are part of a title (e.g. `(#57)`) are
> fine; explanatory parentheticals are not. Descriptions belong in CHANGELOG.md, never here.
